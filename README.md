# IS470 R Lab
 
This repo is for a brief primer on R for Millikin's IS470 class. We're using the [airline data from the USDOT](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time)--we'll use the prezipped file for January, 2015.

I haven't included the actual data in data/ directory because it's 200MB and github doesn't appreciate that.
