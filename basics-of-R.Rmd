# Basics of R

1. Interactive Console

    - look at the basic console

```{r}
cyl6 <- mtcars[mtcars$cyl==6,]
cyl4 <- mtcars[mtcars$cyl==4,]

# is there a significant difference in mpg between 4 and 6 cylinder vehicles?
t.test(cyl6$mpg, cyl4$mpg)
```

    - history (just like a terminal)
    - assign and use variables (we call them objects)
    - use RStudio as an IDE instead
    

2. Running Scripts

    - save your work
    - redo analysis when your source data changes
    - avoid overwriting your objects
    

3. There's No Shame in Using Libraries

    - lots of tasks are a pain in base R, munging, dates, etc
    - use libraries:
        - dplyr
        - lubridate
        - tidyr
        - ggplot2
        - magrittr
